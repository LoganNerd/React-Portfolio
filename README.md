# Creating my React Portfolio!

## Summary:
I created my very own react portfolio from scratch! I have a home page with a little info about me, along with some icons of some of the libraries and languages that we have worked with throughout this 24 week bootcamp! I have a portfolio section with a carousel of all the projects I have completed thus far and a working contact page! I also included a page with my entire resume for even more information. On my footer, I have icons with links to the corresponding social medias!
